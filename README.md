# 🚀 AI Brewing Club

A living collection of LLM, RAG, and AI agent projects — brewed with care by [**AI Brewing Club**](https://www.aibrewingclub.com).

## ☕️ What’s This All About?

AI is evolving fast — and the best way to keep up isn’t just reading papers, it’s **building stuff**.

This repo is my way of learning in public and sharing everything I’ve built (or am building) with large language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and real-world AI agents.

If you're curious about how AI systems actually work in practice — beyond toy demos — you're in the right place.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

Here’s a taste of what’s inside:

- 🧠 Tutorials on how LLMs tick and how to use them effectively  
- 🔎 Working RAG pipelines — from naive to production-ready  
- 🤖 Real-world AI agents solving real-world problems  
- 🛠️ Clean, reusable code to plug into your own projects  

I keep things as simple and hands-on as possible — less fluff, more building.
